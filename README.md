# League of Legends Position Prediction Model
## Framing the Problem
For this project, we will continue to use the League of Legends dataset. The prediction problem that we will be answering for this project is given a player's post-game data, predict their position. To answer this question we are going to be using multiclass classification. Our response variable is going to be the ‘position’ as this tells us if our model predicts correctly. We chose this because we are trying to do a classification problem and we thought it would be interesting to see if there were certain characteristics of a player who plays a certain position and what their stats would be like. The classes that we will be predicting are: ‘top’, ‘jng’, ‘mid’, ‘bot’, and ‘sup’. For this model, we will be evaluating it by using accuracy. Accuracy best describes our data because it would be the most useful in explaining how close we were to the true position. It would tell us exactly how many of those positions we correctly predict. Using the accuracy would be better than using F1-score, precision, or recall because it better encapsulates and represents the data as a whole. The other three error methods we may have chosen are better for data that is binary in its classification as they use false negatives, false positives, true negatives, and true positives. However, in our case, since we're doing a multiclassification problem, False Positive and many other elements that are used in recall, precision, and F1 do not make very much sense here. Since we are given post-game data, we are free to use all the columns to help us with our prediction, except for using the position column since that's what we're trying to predict, since we know all that statistics up front before we make some prediction. 

## Baseline Model
We created a baseline model to predict the ‘position’ in order to make an extremely simple prediction for our data. In our baseline model, we utilized a decision tree classifier with a max depth of 4 to predict the position. For this model, we used two features to predict the ‘position’ on. 
The first feature we used in the model was the amount of gold earned per minute for each player (‘earned gpm’). The ‘earned gpm’ was first standardized to using standard scaler and was also imputed using the median of the standard scaler to replace the missing values with. This feature is a continuous quantitative feature as it can be within a large range of numbers without a definite upper limit and it does not contain small ‘buckets’ like discrete quantitative data does. The second feature we used in the model was the amount of damage inflicted to enemies as a proportion (‘damageshare’). The ‘damageshare’ went through a similar process as the ‘earned gpm’ as it was standardized using standard scaler and then imputed using the missing values with the median of the standard scaler. Like ‘earned gpm’, this feature is also a continuous quantitative feature as it can be within a large range of numbers without a definite upper limit and it does not contain small ‘buckets’ like discrete quantitative data does.
The performance of our baseline model was decently “good” as it was successfully able to predict the players’ position about 52.1% of the time. This is “good” because of the amount of ‘position’s there are in our data (5) meaning that if it was purely guessing, the model would have an accuracy of about 20%. Our model is better than ‘purely guessing’ by a factor of more than 2.5x after implementing the baseline model described above to use the two features ‘earned gpm’ and ‘damageshare’.
